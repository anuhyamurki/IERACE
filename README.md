# IERACE
Focuses on the use of deep reinforcement learning (RL) for game simulation in the context of car racing implementing DDQN.
We apply the deep double Q-learning (DDQN) algorithm to train an agent to drive a car in a 2D racing game.
We develop an RL-based model that can learn to play a racing game by observing the game state and taking
appropriate actions based on the rewards received.
